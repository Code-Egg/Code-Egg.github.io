# How to Install CyberPanel and Set Up a WordPress Blog on Ubuntu 18.04

### Introduction
In this guide, we'll focus on implementing a blazing-fast WordPress site in two parts: First, we'll install CyberPanel and associated software (OpenLiteSpeed, MariaDB, ACME Client, Pure-FTPd, PowerDNS, phpMyAdmin, Rainloop, and PHP). Then, we'll set up SSL and get your WordPress site up and running.

Once you have completed all of the steps in this guide, not only will you have a speedy WordPress site of your own, but you will be prepared to provide personal hosting services for multiple users, if you wish.

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this tutorial, you will need access to a Ubuntu 18.04 server. You can [use a Digital Ocean droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04) for this, although it is not required.

## Requirements
You will also need the following before you can begin this guide:

1. **root user:** The installation must be run as root (sudo will not work).
2. **A registered domain for TLS/SSL security:** 
The easiest way to secure your site is with Letâ€™s Encrypt, which provides free, trusted certificates. CyberPanel will handle this part for you, so all we really need to do is update your registered domain name records to point to your new server. If you do not have a domain, and you are just using this configuration for testing or personal purposes, you can use a self-signed certificate instead.

Once you have a registered domain with the records pointing to your new server, log into the server as the root user and continue below.

## Step 1 - Installing CyberPanel
We will be installing CyberPanel using the CyberPanel installer, which includes all of the necessary packages: web server, multiple PHP versions, database, firewall, etc.

CyberPanel can be installed with a single command and should be installed within 15 minutes depending on the server specifications.


**Note:** 
If you're using DigitalOcean, you can use the one-click app found in the [Marketplace](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=cyberpanel-18-04&utm_source=cyberpanel&utm_campaign=cyberpanel) to launch CyberPanel on Ubuntu 18.04 system in 3 minutes.


Log into the server via SSH. 

Run the following commands to download and exectute the latest version of the CyberPanel installer from the root directory:
```
cd ~ && sh <(curl https://cyberpanel.net/install.sh || wget -O - https://cyberpanel.net/install.sh)
```

You should see the following output from the interactive script:
```

UDP: 53 443

## Step 2 - Logging into the Control Panel
Visit your server's IP address at the CyberPanel port: `YOUR_SERVER_IP:8090`. You will see a login page. Enter `admin` for the **Username** and `RANDOMPASSWORD` for the **Password**. The default language is English, but you can choose a different one if you wish.

**Note:** It's normal to see a "Not secure" message in the browser when visiting a website with a self-signed certificate. To get ride of the warning, you can [issue a valid SSL certificate](https://cyberpanel.net/docs/2-cyberpanel-on-ssl/).

This is your CyberPanel HOME page. Along the left side is the menu, which includes all of the functions for server, admin, reseller, and user. The large middle area is for often-used functions, and the section to the right shows the current status of server resources.

Click the **CREATE WEBSITE** button.
![](/assets/images/cyber-website.png)

Do you have a valid domain and wish to apply a Let's Encrypt certificate? Follow the steps in **Step 3 Option One**. If you are testing, or wish to use a custom or self-signed certificate, scroll down and follow the steps in **Step 3 Option Two**

### Step 3 Option One: Let's Encrypt Certificate
Input the following values to set up your first site:
* **Select Package** `Default`
* **Select Owner**: `admin`
* **Domain Name**: YOUR_DOMAIN
* **Email**: demo@gmail.com
* **Select PHP**: PHP7.3
* **Additional Features**: 
    * **SSL**: Select. This will automatically apply SSL via Let's Encrypt.
    * **DKIM**: DKIM is an Internet Standard that enables a person or organization to associate a domain name with an email message. We can leave it unselected.
    * **open_basedir Protection**: open_basedir can be used to limit the files that can be accessed by PHP to the specified directory-tree, including the file itself. We can leave it unselected. 

Press the **Create Website** button to create the website.

When the website creation completes successfully, you will see the following success message:
![](/assets/images/cyber-siteok.png)


### Step 3 Option Two: Custom Certificate
Input the following values to set up your first site:
* **Select Package** `Default`
* **Select Owner**: `admin`
* **Domain Name**: YOUR_DOMAIN
* **Email**: demo@gmail.com
* **Select PHP**: PHP7.3
* **Additional Features**: 
    * **SSL**: Leave unselected.
    * **DKIM**: DKIM is an Internet Standard that enables a person or organization to associate a domain name with an email message. We can leave it unselected.
    * **open_basedir Protection**: open_basedir can be used to limit the files that can be accessed by PHP to the specified directory-tree, including the file itself. We can leave it unselected. 

Press the **Create Website** button to create the website.
![](/assets/images/cyber-nossl.png)

When the website creation completes successfully, you will see the following success message:
![](/assets/images/cyber-siteok.png)

Next, you will need to manually upload a custom/self-signed certificate. Go back to **HOME > WEBSITES**, and click the **LIST WEBSITE** button. The control panel now lists all of the websites that you have created. Find the one you just made and click the **Manage** button to access the site management page. Click the **Add SSL** button, paste your Cert & Key each into the appropriate box, and press the **Save** button.

## Step 4 - Creating a WordPress Application
Navigate back to **Home > WEBSITES**, and click the **LIST WEBSITE** button.
![](/assets/images/cyber-website.png)

Find the site you just created and click the **Manage** button to access to the management page.

![](/assets/images/cyber-manage.png)

**Note:** If you see an image of a telescope with the words "Failed to Load Preview," you may ignore it, as this is expected while the site is still in development.

Scroll down the page to find the **Application Installer** section. Click the **WP + LSCache** button to install the WordPress application and [the LiteSpeed Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/litespeed-cache/) plugin together.

![](/assets/images/cyber-inside-abc.png)

Input values similar to the following, and then let the control panel handle setting up everything, including WordPress itself, the database, and the plugin:
* **Blog Title:** My Blog
* **Login User:** demouser
* **Login Password:** YOUR_PASSWORD
* **Email:** demo@gmail.com
* **Path:** Leave empty to install under the home directory. Adding a folder name will install under /home/folder.
![](/assets/images/cyber-wpsetup.png)

**Note:** Itâ€™s considered good security practice not to use a common username like "admin" for the administrative account, as many security exploits rely on standard usernames and passwords. Choose a unique username and a strong password for your main account to help keep your site secure.

Click the **Install Now** button to finish the installation. The server will grab the latest WordPress version to install and will automatically set up a database for you.

## Step 5 - Enjoying Your Performance Site
Visit your site using HTTPS: `https://example.com`

To check how fast your page loads from your device, you can use the [Chrome browser developer tool](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools). Press **Control+Shift+J** or **F12** (Windows) or press **Command+Option+J** (Mac). An **Inspect** window will appear. Click the **Network** tab, then choose the **Doc** tab. Refresh the page, and you can see how quickly it loads.
![](/assets/images/cyber-wpload.png)

WordPress installation is now complete, and you may customize your site as you desire.

To access your site's admin, you would visit `https://example.com/wp-admin/`

Log in with: 
* **Username:** demouser
* **Password:** YOUR_PASSWORD

By default, only the LSCache plugin has been installed via the CyberPanel app installer
![](/assets/images/cyber-cache.png)

**Note:** We strongly recommand that you do not remove the LSCache Plugin. It is designed to work with the web server to dramatically speed up your site. In addition to page caching, it supports many optimization features like Image Optimization, Critical CSS Generation, CSS/Javascript/HTML Minification, HTTP/2 Push, Browser Cache and more. These are all things that will improve your page score.

## Conclusion
You now have a secure WordPress site, served with OpenLiteSpeed web server, using the LSCache plugin. CyberPanel will automatically handle the SSL certificate renewal from Letâ€™s Encrypt. To learn more about CyberPanel's advanced functions, take  a look at [CyberPanel's official documentation](https://cyberpanel.net/docs/). 

Now that you've set up one performance site, you can easily create more WordPress websites on your own. CyberPanel comes with a user-friendly WebAdmin GUI. You should spend some time exploring the features, options and settings. Enjoy!
